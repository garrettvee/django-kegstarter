How to contribute
=================

* Fork
* Code
* Pull-request =)


A pull request is the start of a conversation on how to do something.
Feel free to make a PR early on so we can all collaborate.

Before a PR is merged it should be squashed down to one or two commits
so that fixes to tickets are one logical step. If there's major movement
that needs to happen it should happen on a branch, but all "Work in
progress" or "fixing derp" commits should be squashed before merging
to master.


Testing Requirements
====================

100% coverage is really nice to have, but not strongly required. Any
features that are added need to have good test coverage both demonstrate
that the code works as intended and any data validation logic is robust.


Getting Setup
=============
TO BE WRITTEN
Currently exploring docker things, but initially

* Python 3.4
* ``virtualenv-wrapper`` and in a venv that's set to use Python 3.4
* ``pip install -e .\[dev\]``
